# What is Pandoc?

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html) is a content conversion tool created by [John MacFarlane](https://johnmacfarlane.net/).  This free and open source tool can be used by anyone to convert content to different forms of presentation.  Pandoc can be used to convert lightweight markup formats to more complex file types like HTML, Microsoft PowerPoint, PDF, and many more.  For a complete list of what you can convert your files to please check out [this](https://pandoc.org/index.html) list.  Pandoc must be invoked by a terminal. Here is an example command that one could use to convert Markdown files to Microsoft Word documents: `pandoc -s mymarkdowncontent.md -o mywordcontent.docx`.  It is also important to note that after every file conversion you should check the converted file for any mistakes because Pandoc is not perfect.
